# Future Scope – CampusFlow

Although CampusFlow currently automates venue conflict detection
using Google Forms, Google Sheets, Make.com, and Gmail,
the system can be expanded into a full institutional platform.

## 1️⃣ Admin Dashboard

- Web dashboard for institute authorities
- View all bookings in real-time
- Filter by date, venue, or club
- Manual override option for special cases

## 2️⃣ Real-Time Availability Viewer

- Public page where clubs can check
  which venues are free before submitting a request
- Reduces unnecessary rejection emails

## 3️⃣ Institute Email Integration

- Use official institute domain email
  instead of personal Gmail
- Improves professionalism and trust

## 4️⃣ ERP / Institute Portal Integration

- Integrate with college ERP system
- Club verification using student login
- Automated approval workflows

## 5️⃣ Analytics Dashboard

- Monthly booking statistics
- Most used venues
- Peak booking hours
- Conflict frequency analysis

## 6️⃣ QR-Based Venue Access

- Approved booking generates QR code
- Scan at venue entrance for access validation

## 7️⃣ Mobile Application

- Android/iOS app for booking requests
- Push notifications instead of email

CampusFlow can evolve from a hackathon automation
into a complete smart campus infrastructure system.
